# Investigating invasive Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby) and its Impact on Native Fishes in Lake Ontario
Abstract/At a Glance

The compounded impacts of both changing temperatures and invasive species Neogobius melanostomus is thought to have an overall negative impact upon the native species of Lake Ontario; however, these impacts on species occupying the same ecological niche is relatively unclear. This study investigates the impacts on native species fitness, measured by body weight and species abundance, by both the impacts of temperature and interactions with the round goby. Exploring historical data prior to the introduction of the invasive species and the populations of the present day, native species’ body weights and abundances were predicted to be negatively impacted. However, across all species, our results indicate that the effects of temperature is significant on some native species’ fitness, while minimal impacts were observed from the increased abundance of Neogobius melanostomus, indicating further studies should be performed to determine a more conclusive result.
